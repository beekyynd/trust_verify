# Trust Verify

This is a simple Web based Application that allows Users create a profile to build trust with business partners. Each user can be rated by people they have transacted with. All ratings are public.

# Note
No database was used to build this. I used an In-memory Mockup for user registration and reviews which means everything will reset whenever you reload your servers. The only data that will remain are the hardcoded ones in the data.ts file.
